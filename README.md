## Introduction
This repository contains a Python script for generating QR codes with personal details. The application is developed using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, qrcode library for generating QR codes, and Pillow (PIL) library for image processing.

## Features
- User-friendly graphical interface for entering personal details.
- Generates QR codes containing phone number, name, age, and education information.
- Allows users to specify the save location for generated QR codes.
- Validates input fields and provides error messages for missing or incorrect information.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- qrcode
- Pillow (PIL)
- resizeimage

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   
    ```
